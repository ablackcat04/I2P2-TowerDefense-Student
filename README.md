## Game Overview
This game is a two-player cooperative game, 
with one player in charge of the rhythm game part and the other mainly in charge of the Tower defense part.

The player in charge of rhythm game needs to play as well as possible to support the tower defense player, 
you will get money by hitting notes, also,
some tower will only attack when you hit a certain number of note(s) simultaneously.

We don't modify too much on the tower defense part, 
but we synced the attack of those tower which attacks automatically with the music,
in order to maintain a sense of unity. 

The game contains 3 playable songs(or stages), 
which you need to unlock them one by one by passing the song before it on the map, 
similar to the game Lanota.

There will also be stories along the way, 
presented in a visual novel way, 
similar to the game vivid/stasis or Rotaeno.
